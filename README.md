<big>CC3000 wifi lamp</big>

Basically a lamp with 5 colours, a bulb, controlled over wifi.

Currently i am strugling with bugs in the cc3000 module. Even TI recomend using the cc3100 instead, but i already had my cc3000 module before that. 
I will try to update the firmware, because that might fix some bugs. I don't however have an official patch programmer.
