FILES INCLUDED IN THE PROJECT TREE:

system.hpp - contains custom oscillator configuration function prototypes,
reset source evaluation function prototypes, and non-peripheral
microcontroller initialization function prototypes.  It also may contain
system level #define macros and variables.  This file is included
by system.cpp.

user.hpp - contains parameters and function prototypes used in user.c for user
level functions, for example, InitApp();

configuration_bits.cpp - contains device configuration bit macros.  Refer to
the comments in configuration_bits.cpp for instructions on where to get
information about device configuration bits and their corresponding macros.

exceptions.cpp - generally speaking, a user would not modify this file unless
they were having problems resulting in exceptions.  If the code in this file
is entered, that means there is a critical hardware problem or software bug.
The cause register will need evaluated by the user to determine the source
of the problem.  A macro stub is available which can be added to write
the exception cause to flash for troubleshooting exceptions in release mode.

interrupts.cpp - this file contains example stubs for interrupts.  The user
would put the interrupt vectors for their application in interrupts.c.

main.cpp - this is the main code for the project.  Global variables and the
main() function are located in main.cpp  The user would put their primary
program flow in main.cpp, and the operation should be contained in main.c with
an infinite loop.

system.cpp - contains custom oscillator configuration functions, reset source
evaluation functions, and non-peripheral microcontroller initialization
functions.  Functions in system.c would often be called from main.cpp during
device initialization.

user.cpp - Custom user algorithms, user peripheral initialization, data
computation functions, and calculation functions would go here.  Prototypes for
user.cpp would go in user.hpp.

FILES INCLUDED IN THE PROJECT BUT NOT IN THE PROJECT TREE:

#include <xc.h>              /* Defines special function registers, CP0 regs  */
#include <plib.h>            /* Include to use PIC32 peripheral libraries     */
#include <stdint.h>          /* For uint32_t definition                       */
#include <stdbool.h>         /* For true/false definition                     */
#include <sys/attribs.h>     /* For __ISR definition                          */

These files come with the XC32 compiler.  Check the compiler documentation
for more information on these files.
